Build HTML templates for for blank endpoint, blank method, and blank parameter, which we will clone to add new ones

Add hidden inputs that track: total number of endpoints, total number of methods per endpoint

when adding an endpoint: 
	increment total number of endpoints
	clone endpoint template
	update the names/IDs to correspond to the new endpoints index (for now, the last one)
	
requirements:
	Endpoints must have at least one method
	Methods don't necessarily have parameters

todo:
	correct field types (dropdowns, textareas, etc)
	validation on fields
	get links to methods working
	
future:
	drag and drop tree nodes to reorder things?
